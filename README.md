This is a little vibe-coded Hangman game I made with the help of a LLM.  It has some placeholder's for more advanced things like audio and other feathers.

I has a small library of words, and I kept it to a 4th grade level.  I figure if anyone wants to add to it, they sure can.  

No install needed.  It's written in python and i exported it to work in Windows.  No Python install should be needed, but when I wrote it, I had tested it on Python 3.12.X.

Have fun.
